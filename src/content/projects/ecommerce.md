   - Analyzed competitors' apps to identify best practices.
   - Collaborated with the client to prioritize features.
2. **Wireframing & Design**:
   - Created wireframes for user flows.
   - Delivered a sleek design aligning with the brand's identity.
3. **Development**:
   - Built the app using React Native for cross-platform compatibility.
   - Integrated a backend with payment and order tracking APIs.
4. **Testing & Launch**:
   - Conducted rigorous testing for performance and reliability.

## Results
